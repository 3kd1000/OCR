Requires OpenCV2.1
Built on VS2010

When running, try hitting the keys 1, 2, 3 to see the OCR process.

Needs more details but basically it works like this:
1- Learn each possible number by studying and classifying images in the 'c' folder using knn
2- Open given image and convert to greyscale
3- remove noise
4- make black and white and find bounding rectangles for each number
5- analyze each rectangle (number) separately
6- print out the numbers that the image contains and save each number as an image of it's own


All the images in the 'c' folder were generated by a custom freebasic application that I don't include here.
